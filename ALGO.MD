# Two sum                                                                       

## Challenge
Given an array of integers, return indices of two numbers in the array such that their values add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:

```text
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```
                                                       
```ruby
def twoSum(nums, target)
  
end
```
